# Pop Culture Snapshot

Pop culture snapshot is part news aggregator, part top trending list, and part personalized dashboard. It grabs the latest trends in pop culture from APIs across the internet and turns them into "media bubbles". "Media bubbles" contain a name, description, and media category that can be added to your personal dashboard. This allows a user to see daily trends in pop culture and to track their favorite trends in their own dashboard. This allows a user to easily keep up with daily pop culture trends to stay informed in what's cool right now.
