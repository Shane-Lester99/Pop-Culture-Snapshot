# Pop Culture Snapshot

- Fullstack react + redux + nodeJS + express + sequelize + postgres application

- Deployment, Backend, and application configuration built by Shane Lester

- Component development and react redux interface built by Jimmy Yuan and styled/ designed by David Ullauri. Links to their github can be found under contributors.

- Built as part of the TTP CUNY2X bootcamp with first release on a 6 day strict deadline

## What is it?

- Application feeds daily data of pop culture trends in music, tv, movie, videos, and ideas in the form of media bubbles
- These media bubbles give users a ‘snapshot’ of what is happening in pop culture on any given day
- Users can save these media bubbles to their account to keep track of their favorite trends
- Overall, this allows users to keep up with trends in popular culture

## Why is it needed?
- Trends change fast and no one place gives a high level overview of what is happening on any given day
- Hard to keep track of daily trends without looking at lots of different sources
- Media bubbles can be extended to any data that is available, giving users a larger and larger ‘snapshot’ of pop culture trends
- Easily extendable to an API for developers for daily pop culture trends over long periods of time
